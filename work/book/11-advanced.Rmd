# Advanced forecasting methods {#ch-advanced}

In this chapter, we briefly discuss four more advanced forecasting methods that build on the models discussed in earlier chapters.

## Complex seasonality {#sec:complexseasonality}

So far, we have considered relatively simple seasonal patterns such as quarterly and monthly data. However, higher frequency data often exhibits more complicated seasonal patterns. For example, daily data may have a weekly pattern as well as an annual pattern.  Hourly data usually has three types of seasonality: a daily pattern, a weekly pattern, and an annual pattern. Even weekly data can be difficult as it typically has an annual pattern with seasonal period of $365.25/7\approx 52.179$ on average.

Such multiple seasonal patterns are becoming more common with high frequency data recording. Further examples where multiple seasonal patterns can occur include call volume in call centres, daily hospital admissions, requests for cash at ATMs, electricity and water usage, and access to computer web sites.

Most of the methods we have considered so far are unable to deal with these seasonal complexities. Even the `ts` class in R can only handle one type of seasonality, which is usually assumed to take integer values.

To deal with such series, we will use the `msts` class which handles multiple seasonality time series. Then you can specify all of the frequencies that might be relevant. It is also flexible enough to handle non-integer frequencies.

You won't necessarily want to include all of these frequencies --- just the ones that are likely to be present in the data. For example, if you have only 180 days of data, you can probably ignore the annual seasonality. If the data are measurements of a natural phenomenon (e.g., temperature), you might also be able to ignore the weekly seasonality.

Figure \@ref(fig:calls) shows the number of retail banking call arrivals per 5-minute interval between 7:00am and 9:05pm each weekday over a 33 week period.  There is a strong daily seasonal pattern with frequency 169, and a weak weekly seasonal pattern with frequency $169 \times 5=845$. (Call volumes on Mondays tend to be higher than the rest of the week.) If a longer series of data were available, there may also be an annual seasonal pattern.

```{r calls, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Five-minute call volume handled on weekdays between 7am and 9:05pm in a large North American commercial bank. Top panel shows data from 3 March 2003 to 23 May 2003. Bottom panel shows only the first three weeks.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p1 <- autoplot(calls) +
  ylab("Call volume") + xlab("Weeks") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1,33,by=2))
p2 <- autoplot(window(calls, end=4)) +
  ylab("Call volume") + xlab("Weeks") +
  scale_x_continuous(minor_breaks = seq(1,4,by=0.2))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2)
```

### Dynamic harmonic regression with multiple seasonal periods {-}

With multiple seasonalities, we can use Fourier terms as we did in earlier chapters. Because there are multiple seasonalities, we need to add Fourier terms for each seasonal period. In this case, the seasonal periods are 169 and 845, so the Fourier terms are of the form
$$
  \sin\left(\frac{2\pi kt}{169}\right), \qquad
  \cos\left(\frac{2\pi kt}{169}\right), \qquad
  \sin\left(\frac{2\pi kt}{845}\right), \qquad  \text{and}
  \cos\left(\frac{2\pi kt}{845}\right),
$$
for $k=1,2,\dots$. The `fourier` function can generate these for you.

We will fit a dynamic regression model with an ARMA error structure. The total number of Fourier terms for each seasonal period have been chosen to minimize the AICc. We will use a log transformation (`lambda=0`) to ensure the forecasts and prediction intervals remain positive.

```{r callsharmonics, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
#fit <- auto.arima(calls, seasonal=FALSE, lambda=0,
#         xreg=fourier(calls, K=c(10,10)))
#fc <- forecast(fit, xreg=fourier(calls, K=c(10,10), h=2*169))
#autoplot(fc, include=5*169) +
#  ylab("Call volume") + xlab("Weeks")
```

This is a very large model (containing 120+??=?? parameters).

### TBATS models {-}

An alternative approach developed by @DHS11 uses a combination of Fourier terms with an exponential smoothing state space model and a Box-Cox transformation, in a completed automated manner. As with any automated modelling framework, it does not always work, but it can be a useful approach in some circumstances.

A TBATS model differs from dynamic harmonic regression in that the seasonality is allowed to change slowly over time in a TBATS model, while harmonic regression terms force the seasonal patterns to repeat periodically without changing. One drawback of TBATS models is that they can be very slow to estimate, especially with long time series. So we will consider a subset of the `calls` data to save time.

```{r callstbats, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
calls %>%
  subset(start=length(calls)-1000) %>%
  tbats -> fit2
fc2 <- forecast(fit2, h=2*169)
autoplot(fc2, include=5*169) +
  ylab("Call volume") + xlab("Weeks")
```

### Complex seasonality with covariates {-}

TBATS models do not allow for covariates, although they can be included in dynamic harmonic regression models. One common application of such models is electricity demand modelling.

Figure \@ref(fig:elecdemand) shows half-hourly electricity demand in Victoria, Australia, during 2014, along with temperatures in the same period.

```{r elecdemand, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Half-hourly electricity demand and corresponding temperatures in 2014, Victoria, Australia."}
autoplot(elecdemand[,c("Demand","Temperature")], facet=TRUE) +
  scale_x_continuous(minor_breaks=NULL,
    breaks=2014+cumsum(c(0,31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30))/365,
    labels=month.abb) +
  xlab("Time") + ylab("")
```

Plotting electricity demand against temperature shows that there is a nonlinear relationship between the two, with demand increasing for low temperatures (due to heating) and increasing for high temperatures (due to cooling).

```{r elecdemand2, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap=""}
elecdemand %>%
  as.data.frame %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Temperature, y=Demand)) + geom_point() +
    xlab("Temperature (degrees Celsius)") +
    ylab("Demand (GW)")
```

We will fit a regression model with a piecewise linear function of temperature (containing a knot at 18 degrees), and harmonic regression terms to allow for the daily seasonal pattern.

```{r elecdemand3, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE, fig.cap=""}
cooling <- pmax(elecdemand[,"Temperature"], 18)
fit <- auto.arima(elecdemand[,"Demand"],
         xreg = cbind(fourier(elecdemand, c(10,10,0)),
               heating=elecdemand[,"Temperature"],
               cooling=cooling))
```

Forecasting with such models is difficult because we require future values of the predictor variables. Future values of the Fourier terms are easy to compute, but future temperatures are, of course, unknown. We could use temperature forecasts obtain from a meteorological model if we are only interested in forecasting up to a week ahead. Alternatively, we could use scenario forecasting and plug in possible temperature patterns. In the following example, we have used a repeat of the last week of temperatures to generate future possible demand values.

```{r elecdemand4, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#temps <- subset(elecdemand[,"Temperature"], start=NROW(elecdemand)-7*48-1)
#fc <- forecast(fit, xreg=cbind(fourier(temps, c(10,10,0)),
#                           heating=temps, cooling=pmax(temps,18)))
#autoplot(fc)
```

```{r elecdemand5, cache=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#checkresiduals(fc)
```

## Forecasting counts

croston

Poisson models?

Other intermittent demand models


## Vector autoregressions {#VAR}

One limitation with the models we have considered so far is that they impose a unidirectional relationship --- the forecast variable is influenced by the predictor variables, but not vice versa. However, there are many cases where the reverse should also be allowed for --- where all variables affect each other. In Chapter 9, the changes in personal consumption expenditure ($C_t$) were forecast based on the changes in personal disposable income ($I_t$). However, in this case a bi-directional relationship may be more suitable: an increase in $I_t$ will lead to an increase in $C_t$ and vice versa.

An example of such a situation occurred in Australia during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008--2009. The Australian government issued stimulus packages that included cash payments in December 2008, just in time for Christmas spending. As a result, retailers reported strong sales and the economy was stimulated. Consequently, incomes increased.

Such feedback relationships are allowed for in the vector autoregressive (VAR) framework. In this framework, all variables are treated symmetrically. They are all modelled as if they influence each other equally. In more formal terminology, all variables are now treated as "endogenous". To signify this we now change the notation and write all variables as $y$s: $y_{1,t}$ denotes the $t$th observation of variable $y_1$, $y_{2,t}$ denotes the $t$th observation of variable $y_2$, and so on.

A VAR model is a generalisation of the univariate autoregressive model for forecasting a collection of variables; that is, a vector of time series.^[A more flexible generalisation would be a Vector ARMA process. However, the relative simplicity of VARs has led to their dominance in forecasting. Interested readers may refer to @AthEtAl2012.] It comprises one equation per variable considered in the system. The right hand side of each equation includes a constant and lags of all the variables in the system. To keep it simple, we will consider a two variable VAR with one lag. We write a 2-dimensional VAR(1) as
\begin{align}
\label{var1a}
  y_{1,t} &= c_1+\phi _{11,1}y_{1,t-1}+\phi _{12,1}y_{2,t-1}+e_{1,t} (\#eq:var1a)\\
  y_{2,t} &= c_2+\phi _{21,1}y_{1,t-1}+\phi _{22,1}y_{2,t-1}+e_{2,t} (\#eq:var1b)
\end{align}
where $e_{1,t}$ and $e_{2,t}$ are white noise processes that may be contemporaneously correlated. Coefficient $\phi_{ii,\ell}$ captures the influence of the $\ell$th lag of variable $y_i$ on itself, while coefficient $\phi_{ij,\ell}$ captures the influence of the $\ell$th lag of variable $y_j$ on $y_i$.

If the series modelled are stationary we forecast them by directly fitting a VAR to the data (known as a "VAR in levels"). If the series are non-stationary we take differences to make them stationary and then we fit a VAR model (known as a "VAR in differences"). In both cases, the models are estimated equation by equation using the principle of least squares. For each equation, the parameters are estimated by minimising the sum of squared $e_{i,t}$ values.

The other possibility which is beyond the scope of this book and therefore we do not explore here, is that series may be non-stationary but they are cointegrated, which means that there exists a linear combination of them that is stationary. In this case a VAR specification that includes an error correction mechanism (usually referred to as a vector error correction model) should be included and alternative estimation methods to least squares estimation should be used.^[Interested readers should refer to @Ham1994 and @Lut2007.]

Forecasts are generated from a VAR in a recursive manner. The VAR generates forecasts for *each* variable included in the system. To illustrate the process, assume that we have fitted the 2-dimensional VAR(1) described in equations \@ref(eq:var1a)--\@ref(eq:var1b), for all observations up to time $T$. Then the one-step-ahead forecasts are generated by
\begin{align*}
  \hat y_{1,T+1|T} &=\hat{c}_1+\hat\phi_{11,1}y_{1,T}+\hat\phi_{12,1}y_{2,T} \\
  \hat y_{2,T+1|T} &=\hat{c}_2+\hat\phi _{21,1}y_{1,T}+\hat\phi_{22,1}y_{2,T}.
\end{align*}

This is the same form as \@ref(eq:var1a)--\@ref(eq:var1b), except that the errors have been set to zero and parameters have been replaced with their estimates. For $h=2$, the forecasts are given by
\begin{align*}
  \hat y_{1,T+2|T} &=\hat{c}_1+\hat\phi_{11,1}\hat y_{1,T+1}+\hat\phi_{12,1}\hat y_{2,T+1}\\
  \hat y_{2,T+2|T}&=\hat{c}_2+\hat\phi_{21,1}\hat y_{1,T+1}+\hat\phi_{22,1}\hat y_{2,T+1}.
\end{align*}
Again, this is the same form as \@ref(eq:var1a)--\@ref(eq:var1b), except that the errors have been set to zero, parameters have been replaced with their estimates, and the unknown values of $y_1$ and $y_2$ have been replaced with their forecasts. The process can be iterated in this manner for all future time periods.

There are two decisions one has to make when using a VAR to forecast. They are, how many variables (denoted by $K$) and how many lags (denoted by $p$) should be included in the system. The number of coefficients to be estimated in a VAR is equal to $K+pK^2$ (or $1+pK$ per equation). For example, for a VAR with $K=5$ variables and $p=3$ lags, there are 16 coefficients per equation making for a total of 80 coefficients to be estimated. The more coefficients to be estimated the larger the estimation error entering the forecast.

In practice it is usual to keep $K$ small and include only variables that are correlated to each other and therefore useful in forecasting each other. Information criteria are commonly used to select the number of lags to be included.

VARs are implemented in the **vars** package in R. It contains a function `VARselect` to choose the number of lags $p$ using four different information criteria: AIC, HQ, SC and FPE. We have met the AIC before, and SC is simply another name for the BIC (SC stands for Schwarz Criterion after Gideon Schwarz who proposed it). HQ is the Hannan-Quinn criterion and FPE is the "Final Prediction Error" criterion.^[For a detailed comparison of these criteria, see Chapter 4.3 of @Lut2005.] Care should be taken using the AIC as it tends to choose large numbers of lags. Instead, for VAR models, we prefer to use the BIC.

A criticism VARs face is that they are atheoretical. They are not built on some economic theory that imposes a theoretical structure to the equations. Every variable is assumed to influence every other variable in the system, which makes direct interpretation of the estimated coefficients very difficult. Despite this, VARs are useful in several contexts:

  * forecasting a collection of related variables where no explicit interpretation is required;
  * testing whether one variable is useful in forecasting another (the basis of Granger causality tests);
  * impulse response analysis, where the response of one variable to a sudden but temporary change in another variable is analysed;
  * forecast error variance decomposition, where the proportion of the forecast variance of one variable is attributed to the effect of other variables.

### Example: A VAR model for forecasting US consumption {-}

```{r}
library(vars)
```

```{r varselect, cache=TRUE}
VARselect(uschange[,1:2], lag.max=8, type="const")[["selection"]]

var <- VAR(uschange[,1:2], p=3, type="const")
serial.test(var, lags.pt=10, type="PT.asymptotic")

summary(var)
```

The R output on the following page shows the lag length selected by each of the information criteria available in the **vars** package. There is a large discrepancy between a VAR(5) selected by the AIC and a VAR(1) selected by the BIC. This is not unusual. As a result we first fit a VAR(1), selected by the BIC. In similar fashion to the univariate ARIMA methodology we test that the residuals are uncorrelated using a Portmanteau test^[The tests for serial correlation in the "vars" package are multivariate generalisations of the tests presented in Section \@ref(residuals).] The null hypothesis of no serial correlation in the residuals is rejected for both a VAR(1) and a VAR(2) and therefore we fit a VAR(3) as now the null is not rejected. The forecasts generated by the VAR(3) are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:VAR3).


```{r VAR3, fig.cap="Forecasts for US consumption and income generated from a VAR(3).", cache=TRUE}
# forecast(var) %>%
#   autoplot() + xlab("Year")
```

## Neural network models {#sec-9-3-nnet}

Artificial neural networks are forecasting methods that are based on simple mathematical models of the brain. They allow complex nonlinear relationships between the response variable and its predictors.

### Neural network architecture {-}

A neural network can be thought of as a network of "neurons" organised in layers. The predictors (or inputs) form the bottom layer, and the forecasts (or outputs) form the top layer. There may be intermediate layers containing "hidden neurons".

The very simplest networks contain no hidden layers and are equivalent to linear regression. Figure \@ref(fig-10-nnet) shows the neural network version of a linear regression with four predictors. The coefficients attached to these predictors are called "weights". The forecasts are obtained by a linear combination of the inputs. The weights are selected in the neural network framework using a "learning algorithm" that minimises a "cost function" such as MSE. Of course, in this simple example, we can use linear regression which is a much more efficient method for training the model.

```
[shorten \>=1pt,-\>,draw=black!50, node distance=] =[<-,shorten \<=1pt]
=[circle,fill=black!25,minimum size=17pt,inner sep=0pt] =[neuron,
fill=green!50]; =[neuron, fill=red!50]; =[neuron, fill=blue!50]; = [text
width=4em, text centered]

/ in <span>1,...,4</span> (I-) at (0,-) ;

\(O) ;

in <span>1,...,4</span> (I-) edge (O);

(input) <span>Input layer</span>; ;

\@ref(fig-10-nnet)
```

Once we add an intermediate layer with hidden neurons, the neural network becomes non-linear. A simple example is shown in Figure \@ref(fig-10-nnet1).

```
[shorten \>=1pt,-\>,draw=black!50, node distance=] =[<-,shorten \<=1pt]
=[circle,fill=black!25,minimum size=17pt,inner sep=0pt] =[neuron,
fill=green!50]; =[neuron, fill=red!50]; =[neuron, fill=blue!50]; = [text
width=4em, text centered]

/ in <span>1,...,4</span> (I-) at (0,-) ;

/ in <span>1,...,3</span> node[hidden neuron] (H-) at (,-cm) ;

\(O) ;

in <span>1,...,3</span> (H-) edge (O);

(hl) <span>Hidden layer</span>; ; ;

\@ref(fig-10-nnet1)
```

This is known as a *multilayer feed-forward network* where each layer of nodes receives inputs from the previous layers. The outputs of nodes in one layer are inputs to the next layer. The inputs to each node are combined using a weighted linear combination. The result is then modified by a nonlinear function before being output. For example, the inputs into hidden neuron $j$ in Figure \@ref(fig-10-nnet1) are linearly combined to give
$$
  z_j = b_j + \sum_{i=1}^4 w_{i,j} x_i.
$$
In the hidden layer, this is then modified using a nonlinear function such as a sigmoid,
$$
  s(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}},
$$
to give the input for the next layer. This tends to reduce the effect of extreme input values, thus making the network somewhat robust to outliers.

The parameters $b_1,b_2,b_3$ and $w_{1,1},\dots,w_{4,3}$ are "learned" from the data. The values of the weights are often restricted to prevent them becoming too large. The parameter that restricts the weights is known as the "decay parameter" and is often set to be equal to 0.1.

The weights take random values to begin with, which are then updated using the observed data. Consequently, there is an element of randomness in the predictions produced by a neural network. Therefore, the network is usually trained several times using different random starting points, and the results are averaged.

The number of hidden layers, and the number of nodes in each hidden layer, must be specified in advance. We will consider how these can be chosen using cross-validation later in this chapter.


The `avNNet` function from the **caret** package fits a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer. The network specified here contains three nodes (`size=3`) in the hidden layer. The decay parameter has been set to 0.1. The argument `repeats=25` indicates that 25 networks were trained and their predictions are to be averaged. The argument `linout=TRUE` indicates that the output is obtained using a linear function. In this book, we will always specify `linout=TRUE`.

### Neural network autoregression {-}

With time series data, lagged values of the time series can be used as inputs to a neural network. Just as we used lagged values in a linear autoregression model (Chapter 8), we can use lagged values in a neural network autoregression.

In this book, we only consider feed-forward networks with one hidden layer, and use the notation NNAR($p,k$) to indicate there are $p$ lagged inputs and $k$ nodes in the hidden layer. For example, a NNAR(9,5) model is a neural network with the last nine observations $(y_{t-1},y_{t-2},\dots,y_{t-9}$) used as inputs to forecast the output $y_t$, and with five neurons in the hidden layer. A NNAR($p,0$) model is equivalent to an ARIMA($p,0,0$) model but without the restrictions on the parameters to ensure stationarity.

With seasonal data, it is useful to also add the last observed values from the same season as inputs. For example, an NNAR(3,1,2)$_{12}$ model has inputs $y_{t-1}$, $y_{t-2}$, $y_{t-3}$ and $y_{t-12}$, and two neurons in the hidden layer. More generally, an NNAR($p,P,k$)$_m$ model has inputs $(y_{t-1},y_{t-2},\dots,y_{t-p},y_{t-m},y_{t-2m},y_{t-Pm})$ and $k$ neurons in the hidden layer. A NNAR($p,P,0$)$_m$ model is equivalent to an ARIMA($p,0,0$)($P$,0,0)$_m$ model but without the restrictions on the parameters to ensure stationarity.

The `nnetar()` function fits an NNAR($p,P,k$)$_m$ model. If the values of $p$ and $P$ are not specified, they are automatically selected. For non-seasonal time series, the default is the optimal number of lags (according to the AIC) for a linear AR($p$) model. For seasonal time series, the default values are $P=1$ and $p$ is chosen from the optimal linear model fitted to the seasonally adjusted data. If $k$ is not specified, it is set to $k=(p+P+1)/2$ (rounded to the nearest integer).

The surface of the sun contains magnetic regions that appear
as dark spots. These affect the propagation of radio waves and so
telecommunication companies like to predict sunspot activity in order to
plan for any future difficulties. Sunspots follow a cycle of length
between 9 and 14 years. In Figure \@ref(fig:sunspotnnetar), forecasts
from an NNAR(9,5) are shown for the next 20 years.

```{r sunspotnnetar, fig.cap="Forecasts from a neural network with nine lagged inputs and one hidden layer containing five neurons.", cache=TRUE}
fit <- nnetar(sunspotarea)
autoplot(forecast(fit,h=20))
```

The forecasts actually go slightly negative, which is of course impossible. If we wanted to restrict the forecasts to remain positive, we could use a log transformation (specified by the Box-Cox parameter $\lambda=0$):

```{r nnetarsunspots, cache=TRUE}
fit <- nnetar(sunspotarea, lambda=0)
autoplot(forecast(fit,h=20))
```

#### Prediction intervals {-}

Unlike most of the methods considered in this book, neural networks are not based on a well-defined stochastic model, and so it is not straightforward to derive prediction intervals for the resultant forecasts. However, we can still do it using simulation where future sample paths are generated using bootstrapped residuals.

Suppose we fit a NNETAR model to the famous Canadian `lynx` data:

```{r}
(fit <- nnetar(lynx, lambda=0.5))
```

We have used a Box-Cox transformation with $\lambda=0.5$ to ensure the residuals will be roughly homoscedastic (i.e., have constant variance).

The model can be written as
$$
  y_t = f(\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1}) + \varepsilon_t
$$
where $\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1} = (y_{t-1},y_{t-2},\dots,y_{t-8})'$ is a vector containing lagged values of the series, and $f$ is a neural network with 4 hidden nodes in a single layer.

The error series $\{\varepsilon_t\}$ is assumed to be homoscedastic (and possibly also normally distributed).

We can simulate future sample paths of this model iteratively, by randomly generating a value for $\varepsilon_t$, either from a normal distribution, or by resampling from the historical values. So if $\varepsilon^*_{T+1}$ is a random draw from the distribution of errors at time $T+1$, then
$$
  y^*_{T+1} = f(\boldsymbol{y}_{T}) + \varepsilon^*_{T+1}
$$
is one possible draw from the forecast distribution for $y_{T+1}$. Setting 
$\boldsymbol{y}_{T+1}^* = (y^*_{T+1}, y_{T}, \dots, y_{T-6})'$, we can then repeat the process to get
$$
  y^*_{T+2} = f(\boldsymbol{y}^*_{T+1}) + \varepsilon^*_{T+2}.
$$
In this way, we can iteratively simulate a future sample path. By repeatedly simulating sample paths, we build up knowledge of the distribution for all future values based on the fitted neural network. Here is a simulation of 9 possible future sample paths for the lynx data. Each sample path covers the next 20 years after the observed data.


```{r nnetarsim, message=FALSE}
sim <- ts(matrix(0, nrow=20, ncol=9), start=end(lynx)[1]+1)
for(i in seq(9))
  sim[,i] <- simulate(fit, nsim=20)

autoplot(lynx) + forecast::autolayer(sim)
```

If we do this a few hundred or thousand times, we can get a very good picture of the forecast distributions. This is how the `forecast.nnetar` function produces prediction intervals:

```{r}
fcast <- forecast(fit, PI=TRUE, h=20)
autoplot(fcast)
```

Because it is a little slow, `PI=FALSE` is the default, so prediction intervals are not computed unless requested. The `npaths` argument in `forecast.nnetar` controls how many simulations are done (default 1000). By default, the errors are drawn from a normal distribution. The `bootstrap` argument allows the errors to be "bootstrapped" (i.e., randomly drawn from the historical errors).
